Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet and online-based digital technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones, and other digital media and platforms to promote products and services.

On the other hand, Traditional marketing is any form of marketing that uses offline media to reach an audience. Examples include newspaper ads, billboards, mail advertisements, TV, and radio advertisements.

The main difference between digital and traditional marketing is the medium through which an audience encounters a marketing message. While traditional marketing uses media like magazines and newspapers, digital marketing utilizes social media, websites, and other online platforms.
